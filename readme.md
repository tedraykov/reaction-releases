# SDI GitOps™ Releases

## Overview

This repo contains our deployment automation for SDI's Reaction Commerce instances. The tech stack is centered around kubernetes helm charts as the main thing, weave flux as the gitops engine, and augmented with some specialized extras like the strimzi operator for kafka.

The companion repository is [reactioncommerce/reaction-infrastructure](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-infrastructure) which is focused on the base infrastructure layer (k8s cluster, monitoring, elasticsearch, etc), whereas this "sdi-releases" repo is focused on the application itself.

**How It Works™ High Level**

The files in this repo declare a desired state of the full distributed system which includes: which version of code, all the environment variable configuration, some networking, logging, etc. You cause change to the deployed system by creating a pull request against this repository. When your pull request is merged, the weave flux gitops code will roll out changes to make the running system match the new declared state.

To get a change at a high level you:

- clone this repo
- pull the latest develop and make a feature branch
- edit files (details below)
- open a pull request and get it review
- once the PR merges, your changes get deployed
